## Goal
Everyone has to complete the ticketflow and order their tickets. This includes people with impaired vision, hearing or reduced cognitive skills.  This means the front end of this ticketflow will need an interface which is accessible to all people.

## Assignment
We have a debrief written in dutch, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbECHzeHujOjh-6HYDP21BsywCdmTKIj2V3LmoKl5IE/edit?usp=sharing)

- Reduce required actions per screen
